`learnNetSci` is a small `R` package that embeds a `ShinyApp` with learnr tools. 

This tool will be used during the miniPEB - Programming for Evolutionary Biology 2021. 

To install the tool, please use the following:

`devtools::install_github("deisygysi/learnNetSci")`

To run it: 

`learnr::run_tutorial("PEB2021", package = "learnNetSci")`

It will open a page on your browser and you can use `R` from there. 

Have fun :)
